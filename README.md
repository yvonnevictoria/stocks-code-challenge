# Stocks App
## Limitations and Considerations
- Used `create-react-app` to build this project as it quickly creates a project with all the nice stuff included (Linting, Jest, etc.). I've built some of my hobby projects from scratch - can walk through those to demonstrate this skill.


## Assumptions
- The app only needs to cater for one user.
-

- Didn't use Boom
- Created own elements (inputs, modal) to show I can
- Tested half the items - stopped writing tests as it was taking too much time. At least one suite of tests for everything to show I can write a range of them (reducers, sagas, containers, components, node handlers, services)
